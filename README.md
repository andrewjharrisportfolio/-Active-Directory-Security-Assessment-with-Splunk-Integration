# -Active-Directory-Security-Assessment-with-Splunk-Integration

## Objective


In this project, I set up a comprehensive Active Directory (AD) environment to evaluate security measures and incident detection capabilities. The project involved deploying a Splunk server integrated with a Windows Server configured as a domain controller.

### Skills Learned


To assess the robustness of the Active Directory setup against brute force attacks.

To analyze the effectiveness of Splunk in detecting and logging potential security incidents.

To identify gaps in security measures and provide recommendations for strengthening AD defenses.

### Tools Used


Windows Server - Used to configure the domain controller and manage Active Directory (AD) settings.

Splunk - Deployed for log analysis to identify security incidents and track authentication attempts during the attack simulation.

Crowbar (on Kali Linux) - Used for brute force attack simulations on the target machine to test security vulnerabilities.

Kali Linux - The operating system environment for running the Crowbar tool and conducting security testing.
Atomic Red Team Framework - Used to simulate adversarial tactics and techniques based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

MITRE ATT&CK Framework - A knowledge base used for mapping and identifying tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in adversarial attacks.
## Steps
1. I added the static IP For My Splunk Server Running on Ubuntu

2. I used the Command "IP A" On the Ubuntu Server To Display The Network Settings
